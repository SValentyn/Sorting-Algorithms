It is very important to know how the basic sorting algorithms used in development work. Therefore, in the project, a comparative study of various sorting algorithms was conducted. Among them were:
  1. Sorting "Bubble"
  2. Sorting "Selection"
  3. Sorting "Insertion"
  4. Sorting "Comb"
  5. Sorting "Shell"
  6. Sorting "Stooge"
  7. Sorting "Quick"
  8. Sorting "Shaker"
  9. Sorting "Gnome"

A comparative table of sorting algorithms [does not belong to me](https://medium.com/@george.seif94/a-tour-of-the-top-5-sorting-algorithms-with-python-code-43ea9aa02889), but it clearly shows the complexity of each of the algorithms (some are not presented), which is the main factor that influences the speed of the algorithm.
