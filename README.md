It is very important to know how the basic sorting algorithms used in development work. Therefore, in the project, a comparative study of various sorting algorithms was conducted. Among them were:
  1. Sorting "Bubble"
  2. Sorting "Selection"
  3. Sorting "Insertion"
  4. Sorting "Comb"
  5. Sorting "Shell"
  6. Sorting "Stooge"
  7. Sorting "Quick"
  8. Sorting "Shaker"
  9. Sorting "Gnome"

The comparison table of sorting algorithms [does not belong to me](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Summary-of-the-best-case-average-case-and-worst-case2_tbl1_274640372), but it clearly shows the leaders in speed.
